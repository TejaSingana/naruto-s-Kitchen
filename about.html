    <h1><center>FAMOUS ITEAMS IN OUR KITCHEN</center> </h1><br><br>
      <div class="iteam1">
        <h2>CHICKEN-RAMEN:</h2><br><br>
       <center><img src="./ramen.avif"  style="border-radius: 40px;" alt=""></center> <br><br>
        <P>Ramen is one of the most popular options at the moment when choosing something to eat in Japan. It is a bowl of wheat noodles served in a soy sauce or miso soup mixed with many kinds of ingredients. The most typical ingredients are slices of pork, green onions, seaweed and egg. I can´t compare the flavor of this dish with anything else I have tasted before. The most important part of this dish is the soup. It has the most tasty flavor I have ever tried, and can range from soft to strong depending on where you order it. The way the pork is cooked, makes it so soft that sometimes it breaks into pieces as soon as you catch it with your chopsticks.</P><br><br>

      <div class="iteam2">
        <h2>TEMPURA:</h2><br><br>
      <center> <img src="./tempura.avif"   style="border-radius: 40px;" alt=""></center> <br><br>
         <p>Tempura is a Japanese fried dish made mostly from seafood and vegetables. It is seasoned with a sauce made with soy sauce, ginger and sugar. Tempura can be made using almost any and every vegetable. The size of the piece has to be able to be eaten in one bite and despite being deep fried, Tempura does not have an oily texture. Tempura is usually served with Tetsuyu sauce that is a mix of consommé, sweet sake, soy sauce, ginger, radish and spices.<br><br></p>

         <h2>Kare-Raisu (Curry Rice):</h2>
         <center> <img src="./Kare-Raisu (Curry Rice).avif"  style="border-radius: 40px;" alt=""></center><br><br>
         <p>Also a very popular, simple and delicious dish that we can find in Japan, Kare-Raisu is just rice with curry but the taste is certainly different from any other curry dishes. To make Japanese curry, you can use a variety of meats and vegetables. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots and sweet potatoes, and the meats used are chicken, pork, beef and sometimes duck.</p><br><br>
